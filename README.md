# FoodRecommendationSystem-GeneticAlgorithm

### ‚≠ê Project Name : Foodbank-Data-based Diet Recommendations 
#### ‚åõ Related Class : Genetic Algorithm
#### üîë Keywords : genetic algorithm, chromosome, crossover, tournament, selection, population.
##### Notes : Shows the choices of diet (combinations of food) where their total calories are closest to the desired calorie intake. The choices are taken from lists of popular foods in each category of protein, vegetables, fruits, and carbohydrates. The resulting choices are 'individuals' picked through tournament selection form the population.


##### The desired UI is intended to look like this :

##### Due to time constraints, however, only the alpha prototype (with the GA implementation) is finished. This is what GA.java will show.
